### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine before 2.2.220 can be started via the CLI with the argument `-webAdminPassword`, which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console. Therefore, a local user is able to access the password by listing the processes and their arguments [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.3.0, 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.0, 3.1.0, 3.0.0
* WSO2 Open Banking AM : 2.0.0, 1.5.0, 1.4.0


### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
In WSO2 API Manager the H2 web-based console is disabled by default and the deployment.toml configuration related feature to enable/disable the H2 web console is removed from APIM 4.2.0 onwards. Moreover, the vulnerability is reported when starting the H2 web based console using the CLI with a clear text password which is not applicable for API Manager.

Furthermore, the CVE-2022-45868 is a disputed vulnerability since the vendor states that, 
> This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.

### CONCLUSION

* [CVE-2022-45868](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45868) is reported for H2 database engine before 2.2.220
* H2 console has been disabled by default and the configuration to enable the console is removed from APIM 4.2.0 onwards.
