### REPORTED VULNERABILITY
The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine before 2.2.220 can be started via the CLI with the argument `-webAdminPassword`, which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console. Therefore, a local user is able to access the password by listing the processes and their arguments [^1].

### REPORTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.3.0, 4.2.0, 4.1.0, 4.0.0, 3.2.0, 3.1.0, 3.0.0
* WSO2 Open Banking AM : 2.0.0, 1.5.0, 1.4.0
* Any other WSO2 products containing the H2 Database Engine before 2.2.220


### WSO2 JUSTIFICATION
The vulnerability is reported when starting the H2 web based console using the CLI with a clear text password which is not applicable for WSO2 products.

Furthermore, the H2 web based console is disabled by default, and newer WSO2 product versions including APIM 4.2.0 onwards even removes deployment.toml configuration option to enable/disable the H2 web console. 

Furthermore, the CVE-2022-45868 is a disputed vulnerability since the vendor states that, 
> This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.

### CONCLUSION
Due to following key points,
* [CVE-2022-45868](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45868) is reported for H2 database engine before 2.2.220
* H2 console has been disabled by default and the configuration to enable the console is removed from APIM 4.2.0 onwards.

Therefore, WSO2 concludes that **this is not an exploitable vulnerability in WSO2 products**, and **an H2 update will not be performed due to CVE-2022-45868**[^1].
