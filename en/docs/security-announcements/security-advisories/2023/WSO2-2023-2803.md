### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager : 4.2.0


### OVERVIEW
Broken Authentication Vulnerability in REST API Endpoints.

### DESCRIPTION
A malicious actor could manipulate the REST API path and bypass authentication checks relevant to some Rest APIs.

### IMPACT
Considering the most critical REST API endpoint affected by this vulnerability, the successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to impersonate and authenticate as a different targeted user (including an administrator, given the username of the administrator user is known to the malicious actor).


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:

* [https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-carbon-auth-rest/pull/216](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-carbon-auth-rest/pull/216)


!!! info todo
    **If you are a WSO2 customer with Support Subscription, please use [WSO2 Updates](https://wso2.com/updates/) in order to apply the fix.**

Or else you may recommend to append the following configuration lines to the `<PRODUCT-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and restart the server.


```toml
[[resource.access_control]]
context="(.*)/((\\.+)|(.*;+.*)|%2e)/(.*)"
permissions = ["/"]
secure=true
http_method="all"
``` 
If you have already applied the similar configuration in your `deployment.toml`, you can add the above given configuration as a new config & restart the server.
