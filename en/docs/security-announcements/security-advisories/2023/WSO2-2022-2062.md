### OVERVIEW
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the management console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to improper output encoding, a Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be carried out by
tampering the parameter in the management console.

### IMPACT
By leveraging the XSS attack, an attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, make
changes in the UI of the web page, retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. However, since all
the session related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flag and protected, session hijacking or similar
attacks would not be possible.
