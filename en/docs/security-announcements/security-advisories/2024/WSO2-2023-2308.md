### OVERVIEW
Potential minor information disclosure has been identified on the management console.


### DESCRIPTION
Due to the insufficient privilege check at the user interface (UI) level, users who do not have access to the Registry and Entitled search feature in the management console can access the UI of the mentioned feature by directly accessing the relevant URI. However, such users will not be able to perform any unauthorized actions since performing actions requires specific privileges.


### IMPACT
There is no significant impact for this vulnerability. However, we deliver the fix as best practice, with the intention of preventing the disclosure of the affected UI as well when the user does not have required privileges.


### SOLUTION
If the latest version of the affected WSO2 product is not mentioned under the affected product list, you may migrate to the latest version to receive security fixes. Otherwise you may apply the relevant fixes to the product based on the public fix:
