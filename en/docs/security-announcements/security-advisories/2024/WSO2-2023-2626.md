### OVERVIEW
A Potential open redirection vulnerability in callback urls.


### DESCRIPTION
The provided default regex pattern for validating callback URI in User account recovery, Self Registration, Lite User registration flows are vulnerable to potential open redirection vulnerability.


### IMPACT
By using social engineering techniques, an attacker could persuade a user to click on a valid link (but with a malicious payload) and get the user redirected to an attacker controlled page where a phishing attack could be executed to obtain highly sensitive information or harm otherwise.


### SOLUTION
In order to mitigate the identified vulnerability, It is highly recommended to apply the below given regex pattern for the relevant areas.

* Account Recovery
    Identity Provider -> Resident -> Account Management -> Account Recovery -> Recovery callback URL regex: 
    
    ```
    regexp=(https://((example1.com)|(example2:port))/.*)
    ```

* Self Registration
    Identity Provider -> Resident -> User Onboarding-> Self Registration -> User self registration callback URL regex: 
    
    ```
     regexp=(https://((example1.com)|(example2:port))/.*)
    ```

* Lite User Registration
    Identity Provider -> Resident -> User Onboarding-> Lite User Registration -> Lite User registration callback URL regex: regexp=(https://((example1.com)|(example2:port))/.*)

Moreover, the product documentations are updated with the corrected configuration samples.
