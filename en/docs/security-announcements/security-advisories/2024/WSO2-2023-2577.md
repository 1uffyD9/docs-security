### OVERVIEW
Potential username enumeration in self registration flow.


### DESCRIPTION
Product provided reCaptcha [^1] validation to prevent possibility of username enumeration. Even when reCaptcha validation is enabled, due to the absence of a validation in the check available username feature executed during the self-registration flow, a malicious actor could exploit this feature and harvest information about users who have already registered.


### IMPACT
The discovery of valid usernames can increase the risk of brute force attacks, social engineering attacks, and information leakage. Attackers can use the list of usernames to craft targeted phishing emails or other social engineering attacks to trick users into divulging sensitive information. Moreover, the presence of username enumeration could damage the reputation of the organization responsible for the system and lead to loss of customer trust, regulatory non-compliance, and legal and financial consequences.
