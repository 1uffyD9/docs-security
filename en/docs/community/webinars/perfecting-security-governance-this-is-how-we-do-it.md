<p class="doc-info">Date: 24th Oct 2019</p>
___

Security is a top priority and an integral part of the software development process at WSO2. While we work proactively to secure WSO2 offerings, we have also set multiple verifications and enforcement points to ensure security at each phase of the software development lifecycle.

During this webinar, we will discuss how the WSO2 Platform Security team collaborates with other product teams, customers, and external security researchers to manage the overall security of all WSO2 offerings. The webinar will focus on processes, guidelines, and tools that are used to govern the security of WSO2 offerings. The complete list of discussion topics include:

* How security is integrated into the software development life cycle
* WSO2 Secure Engineering Guidelines followed by all the engineers to produce secure software
* Mandatory security checks performed before releasing a product
* The security vulnerability reporting process
* The security patch release strategy
* The WSO2 Platform Security Team and how they work with other parties
* Security researcher acknowledgment and reward program
* How you can become a contributor and gain acknowledgment
