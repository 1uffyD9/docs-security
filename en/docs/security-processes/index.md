# Security Processes and Programs Overview

This section explains the WSO2 security processes and programs on how we have incorporated security into out products, 
how we manage any product-vulnerabilities, and our responsible disclosure policy. 

* [Secure Software Development Process](secure-software-development-process.md):
  Our Secure Software Development Lifecycle that illustrates how we have incorporated security checkpoints 
  (such as peer reviews, static scanning, dynamic scanning and dependency scanning) into the product lifecycle. 
  Also explains the various tools and practices that we followed when implementing and releasing products.
* [Vulnerability Management Process](vulnerability-management-process.md): 
  How we manage vulnerabilities related to our products.
* [Reward and Acknowledgement Program](../security-reporting/reward-and-acknowledgement-program/index.md): 
  How security researchers can disclose vulnerabilities or security issues to WSO2, and get rewarded and acknowledged.
    * [Security Hall of Fame](../security-reporting/reward-and-acknowledgement-program/hall-of-fame.md): Researchers who have 
      assisted us to identify vulnerabilities related to WSO2 Products and Systems links.
