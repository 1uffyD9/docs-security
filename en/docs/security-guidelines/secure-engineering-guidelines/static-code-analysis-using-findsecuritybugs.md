## Introduction
This document provides details of all necessary steps for configuring FindBugs[^1] and Find Security Bugs[^2] for scanning source code in order to discover security threats. 


## Installation - IntelliJ Idea - FindBugs Plugin
Once you open IntelliJ IDEA, you can go to **Configure** &rarr; **Plugins** in the opening window.

If you have already opened a project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can go to **File** &rarr; **Settings** and in the left panel of the Settings window, select Plugins.

You can install the FindBugs plugin in two ways. If you have an internet connection, you can click on the **Browser repositories** button and get the plugin installed. If not you can download the FindBugs plugin for IntelliJ IDEA[^3] and go with the **Install plugin from disk** option where you can browse and provide the already downloaded plugin.

When you go with the **Browse repositories** option, you can search for the findbugs plugin and select **FindBugs-IDEA** and get it installed.

## Installation - IntelliJ Idea - Find Security Bug Plugin
Once you have installed the FindBugs plugin in IntelliJ IDEA, in the bottom of the IDE you will see the **FindBugs-IDEA** button. Upon clicking on it you can see all the settings of it, in a panel.

Now we have to enable the **FindSecurityBugs** plugin which comes with FindBugs. This is for finding the security bugs in your code. Click on the **Plugin Preferences** button.

Under the **Plugins** section of the **General** tab, click on the **+** button and select **Add Find Security Bugs**.

Once the FindSecurityBugs plugin is added, click on **Apply** and then **OK**.

Now we have successfully installed FindBugs plugin in IntelliJ IDEA and also have enabled the FindSecurityBugs plugin in it. Letâ€™s perform a static code analysis and get to know all the bugs we have in the code.


## Code Analysis
To analyze the project, right click on the project and go to **FindBugs** -> **Analyze Scope Files**. With this, the scanning will happen only under the selected folder. You can also go with **Analyze Module Files** which would scan the particular module you have selected and also **Analyze Project Files** which would scan the entire project.

Once the static scan is completed, you can see the identified bugs in the **FindBugs-IDEA** panel. Since we have enabled the FindSecurityBugs plugin, it will list all the identified security issues under the **Security** category.

## Report Generation 
You can export the reported bugs for further analysis. For that, click on the **Export Bug Collection** to **XML/HTML** button.

A generated report would look like below.

If you go to the **Security Warnings** section, you can see a detailed explanation for each identified security issue.
