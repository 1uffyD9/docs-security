# Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines

<p class="doc-info">Version: 1.5 | Date: 14th Sep 2021</p>
___

We are truly grateful for our customers, security researchers, and community users for responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities to us. Your efforts help us make our products (e.g. WSO2 API Manager), services (e.g. WSO2 API Cloud), and open source projects (e.g. Siddhi) more secure, and thereby helps protect the entire WSO2 user community.

When reporting security vulnerabilities, you need to adhere to a few guidelines. This document highlights the points that need to be considered before reporting a vulnerability, the process of disclosing a vulnerability, and the content that needs to be included in a vulnerability report. 

Some of the vulnerabilities that you come across in the products that were downloaded from [wso2.com](http://wso2.com/) might have already been fixed. For more information on the security advisories issued publicly by WSO2, see [Security Advisories](/security-announcements/security-advisories/) page.

### Prerequisites for reporting Vulnerabilities

!!! attention "Note"
    For WSO2 products, please make sure to go through the prerequisites before you run an automated security scan or perform a penetration test against them.

* Security aspects of the product are hardened
* Make sure to follow the guidelines provided under [Security Guidelines for Production Deployment](security-guidelines-for-production-deployment.md). These guidelines might mitigate the security concerns you are experiencing.
* If you are a WSO2 subscription holder, ensure that you have installed all the Security updates.
* If you are a security researcher, we encourage you to download the latest product version available before testing.
* If you are a security researcher who is focusing on reward and acknowledgements, please refer to our [Reward and Acknowledgement Program](/security-processes-programs/reward-and-acknowledgement-program/).


### Responsible Disclosure of Vulnerabilities
Based on the ethics of responsible disclosure, it is recommended to follow the process given below to report security vulnerabilities.

* If you are an independent security researcher or a community user, you must only use the mailing lists mentioned in Table 1.
* If you are a customer of WSO2, you can either use the mailing lists mentioned in Table 1 or open a ticket in the Support Portal.

<p class="add-caption">Table 1: Email addresses for security issue reporting</p>

!!! info
    Above Security mailing lists are highly confidential internal mailing lists that are only visible to a selected group within WSO2. This includes the Security and Compliance Team members, Security Champions of product, service, and open source project teams, and people who hold leadership roles within WSO2. All the vulnerability reports are treated with the highest priority and confidentiality.

    If you wish to send secure messages to security mailing lists, you may use the GPG keys mentioned in Table 1.

!!! warning "Please note!"

    Apart from the channels mentioned above, please **do not use any other medium to report security vulnerabilities** of WSO2. This includes, but is not limited to, repositories like GitHub, public forums, blogs and other websites, social media, and public and private chat groups.

    Further, kindly **refrain from sharing the vulnerability details you come across with other individuals**. The vulnerability can only be publicized after we complete the mitigation actions. We will work closely with the reporter and will keep him/her updated on our progress.


### What Constitutes a Proper Vulnerability Report
Please use the following template when reporting vulnerabilities so that it contains all the required information and helps expedite the analysis and mitigation process.

* Name of the vulnerable WSO2 product, project, or service and its version (if applicable).
* A high-level overview of the issue.
* Steps to reproduce. Feel free to send us a screen cast. 
* Self-assessed severity and impact.
* Any proposed solution.


### Vulnerability Handling Process
An overview of the vulnerability handling process:

* The user reports the vulnerability privately to a security mailing list or through the Support Portal. The initial response time is less than 24 hours.
* The relevant team at WSO2 fixes the vulnerability and QA verifies the solution.
* The fix is distributed:
    - If the issue is of a product, distribute the patches to the subscription customers first. Then disclose it publicly after 4 weeks.
    - If the issue is of a service, apply the fix to the deployment.
    - If the issue is of an open source project, apply the fix to the master branch, and release a new version of the distribution if required.
* The reporter is kept updated on the progress of the process.
