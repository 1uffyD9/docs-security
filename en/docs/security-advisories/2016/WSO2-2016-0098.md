### OVERVIEW
WSO2 products are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue via LogViewer Admin Service.


### DESCRIPTION
An authenticated user can download configuration files in the filesystem via downloadArchivedLogFiles operation in LogViewer admin service. The request to the admin service accepts a file path relative to the carbon log file directory (i.e. <WSO2_PRODUCT_HOME\>/repository/logs), hence can access any file in the file system.


### IMPACT
An authorized user with admin privileges can download any file in the file system through LogViewer admin service.


### SOLUTION
Apply the following patches based on your products by following the instructions in the README file. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](https://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
