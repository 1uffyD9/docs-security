### OVERVIEW
An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the error responses for the API requests received by API Manager 2.0.0 for invalid resource paths.


### DESCRIPTION
The requests made to an API with resource paths containing invalid contexts/resource names/methods that are made of malicious scripts could result in reflected XSS attacks via the error responses returned by the API Manager.


### IMPACT
If the error response containing the malicious script which was sent along with the request gets displayed on the client side, that script could get executed in the userâ€™s browser resulting in a reflected XSS attack.


### SOLUTION
Apply the patch WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.4.0-0398 for API Manager 2.0.0. Follow the instructions in the README file inside the patch. Patches can also be downloaded from [Security Patch Releases](http://wso2.com/security-patch-releases/). If you have any questions, please post them to <security@wso2.com>.
