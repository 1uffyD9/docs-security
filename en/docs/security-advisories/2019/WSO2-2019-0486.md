### AFFECTED PRODUCTS
* WSO2 API Manager


### OVERVIEW
A potential Unvalidated Redirect vulnerability has been identified in the web app info page (Web app listing) of the carbon console.


### DESCRIPTION
Open Redirect vulnerability is discovered in the web app info page, where the page will be redirected directly to the URL using the **defaultHostname** in the request payload which can be a malicious one.


### IMPACT
An attacker can modify the **defaultHostname** to a hostname value of a malicious site, and trick a user to invoke the modified URL. This redirects the user to the malicious site and the attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials or other sensitive information.


### SOLUTION
The recommended solution is to remove **org.wso2.carbon.webapp.list.ui** jar file from  <API-M_HOME\>/repository/components/plugins.


!!! info todo
    If you are using newer versions of affected products than the ones mentioned in the **SOLUTION** section, this vulnerability is fixed.
    
    It is highly recommended to migrate older versions of the WSO2 products to the [latest released version](https://wso2.com/products/carbon/release-matrix/) to receive security fixes.
