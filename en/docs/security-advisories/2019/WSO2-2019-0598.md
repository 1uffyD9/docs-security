### OVERVIEW
Providing improvement to the Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) prevention in the Shindig webapp.


### DESCRIPTION
This vulnerability can be exploited by misusing the UI gadgets loading capability of the shindig web application. An attacker can alter a specific URL in the request causing the server to initiate a GET request to the altered URL.


### IMPACT
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can use the server to perform arbitrary external service interactions. This could be especially used to interact with the nodes of an internal network, which are otherwise hidden to the outside by the network rules. An attacker can leverage this to footprint and reconnaissance a network, and in addition to that, if there are internal endpoints that do state changing operations upon GET requests, then it is possible to violate the integrity of them well. Depending on the level of protection enforced at endpoints, the impact of this vulnerability may vary.


### SOLUTION
Upgrade the product version to 5.8.0 or higher which are not affected by this SSRF vulnerability. If you have any questions, post them to <security@wso2.com>.
